                        <p>The phone rang twice. Laura jumped from the chair and fell to the ground like a heavy stone. The phone kept ringing while she hugged her knees in fear and shook violently in her body. She was paralyzed in a state of terror; her blood had turned into cold ice. She had been walking in fear for months and often jolted in her dreams. But her agitation could express itself so aggressively on the outside for the first time. "Hi" She picked up the phone timidly and inaudibly. "I want to talk to you. Stop ignoring me.". Laura remained silent while her head was drowning in a dark sea of memories. The events of the past months emerged from the depth of her mind in sharp detail, as though she had travelled back in time.</p> 

                        <p>Three months before, When she first met Tarek at the public beach, Laura couldn't care less about his existence. Lara was a dedicated international college student who had recently moved to the United Arab Emirates from Italy, her country of origin, with a scholarship. Laura was drawn entirely into the academic life, filled with lectures and assignments, and busy enjoying the company of incredible brilliant students who would engage in all kinds of intellectual conversations. Laura was not particularly beautiful, but she provoked attention from men in the streets of Abu Dhabi, maybe for her curly hair and joyful smile or perhaps the white, pale tone of her skin. Without much reflection and to introduce some sort of distraction from the monotonous routine of the campus, Laura turned to Tinder, a commonly used dating app, hoping to spice up her life. At the core of her decision was a desire for connection and friendship in the UAE, but really she was just bored of the university campus. She made the first move and asked one of her Tinder matches, Tarek, to meet her at the public beach, where she would often spend her free afternoons during her freshman year. Tarek was one of the few matches on Tinder who could put a few words after another without making tons of grammatical mistakes. His way of texting was not too boring since it was interspersed with jokes, and it had moved slightly past the questions "how are you" and "what are your hobbies", which Laura found dull. 
                        Nonetheless, on the day of the first date, Tarek had been nearly forgotten, and he laid just at the back of Laura's mind. Forgetful of the date, Laura had jumped in the sea in complete liberation of any preoccupation and then rested on the sand. The sea was in front of her, and a novel by Truman Capote was in her hands. She felt so rich in her soul and so content with her existence, and she kept wondering why anyone would ever choose to chase success when everything was already at human's disposal. So, very dissuaded in her ethical reflections regarding the meaning of life, she presented herself to Tarek with a vacationist vibe, wild hair, and a joyful smile. 
                        "My name is Tarek; it's a pleasure to meet you". He was slightly embarrassed, wondering how he could initiate any sort of conversation with this appealing angel on the sand. He was very tall, brunette by complexion, cunning black eyes, masculine black eyebrows sharply encircling his eyes, and a short stubble beard. We mentioned that she couldn't care less about her date, but as he walked next to her with perfect posture and elegant stride, she grew attracted and intimidated by his appearance. While he was only twenty-four, Tarek looked like a mature man, strong and experienced. Tarek was also an expat in the UAE, who had moved from Egypt with his father nine years before, and after completing his Bachelor's degree, was working as a network engineer in Abu Dhabi. Despite being given a scholarship by his university, he boasted about his lack of interest in his studies. He was too busy partying and drinking in clubs and could cram the night before his exam. He did not know what to study, so he let a friend decide. He also vaunted how he had never read a book in his life. Upon hearing this, Laura doubted that they could be compatible; she was pretty tranquil and deeply valued culture and education. Still, she tried not to be arrogant and to quickly dismiss his company. After all, he seemed intelligent and witful. She was also insecure. It is likely, thought Laura, that Tarek will perceive me as a kid or as a nerd, and she tried to mask her insecurities by engaging in his impersonal conversation. He asked her to play the game of two truths and one lie, a cunning and original expedient to break the ice. She was slightly bored by the conversation and remained pretty neutral in her judgement of Tarek, giving him a chance just for his elegant posture and the originality of his game. 
</p>
                        <p>The two started dating with regularity once a week; they would meet in the centre of Abu Dhabi or Yas Mall as it was the middle point between her university and New al Falah, in which Tarek was working. Laura usually found the dates habitual and unsurprising. Time would go by walking in the same streets as previous weeks, being often quiet or at most in light conversation. Despite walking at length, Tarek did not seem interested in exploring new places, so they memorized each corner of Hamdan Street from the Sheikh Hazza Bin Sultan Mosque bus stop to the World Trade Centre. Laura often proposed to Tarek to visit Corniche beach, where they first met, only a few metres apart from Hamdan. But Laura couldn't convince Tarek to exit the known path or decide anything about the date. Nonetheless, Laura appreciated that Tarek was present with her. He was rarely distracted by technology, and she felt they were creating some sort of genuine connection, sound and honest. Laura continued frequenting him without particular enjoyment and neither discomfort. She was slightly detached and assent from the situation as if she was watching an old aesthetic film without words which expands time with experience and calmness. Dates were still different from her routine. She could passively observe the dynamics of Hamdan Street, which is very characteristical and densely populated, and she could get to know Tarek, a quiet man and somehow mysterious, but was mysterious, not stupid and seemed quite thoughtful.</p>

                        <p>Only one month later, Tarek had turned to what had become their usual Friday date with a stern face. Barely responsive to any sort of greeting from Laura, he was very short in his speech, and his face grimaced in annoyance. Moreover, he seemed agitated. "Walk faster; we need to reach the centre of Hamdan Street before the start of the prayer". The sun was scorching hot, the streets were empty due to the late morning heat, and Laura was not feeling too well due to her period, but she had to run after him for a long time, often falling back behind. "Why don't you talk to me? Have we met to stay quiet? Or for what reason exactly?!" complained the irritated Tarek, looking back. She had been trying to initiate a conversation, but he did not seem to pay attention to her, and certainly, he did not seem interested in what she had to say. After they reached the centre, he unexpectedly disappeared for an hour, left her standing alone in front of a shop and asked her not to move since he would come back in minutes. Later in the day, Tarek engaged in long phone calls in Arabic, from which Laura was obviously excluded. He clarified that in any way, such phone calls, even if they concerned his job as a network engineer in the periphery of Abu Dhabi, were still much more interesting than talking to her since she clearly had nothing to say. After the numerous phone calls, he explained the situation to Laura "You are just a college student. Your life is simple. You won't understand the real world until you grow older. "She swallowed his words quietly, feeling useless and immature; slightly bowed her head. After being often dismissed and this degrading explanation, She grew in the conviction that she shouldn't initiate a conversation with Tarek lest her thoughts were too stupid for him, and he would easily disregard her. While they were returning to the Mosque, he was annoyed again. "You are so dumb; how can you so often trip on the sidewalk? don't you understand that the bus leaves in less than ten minutes, and you have to walk faster?" She swallowed in again and sighted. The date was painful, and it felt lonely as if she had gone out in the city by herself. She had waited at length for the consideration of Tarek.</p>

                        <p>Another two months passed, and Laura shyly kissed him on the cheek. Both were of religious upbringing; Tarek was Muslim and Laura Christian. He did not want to push her, aware of the meaning of physical love in both religions and worried that passion could be perceived as sinful to her. She had grown attached to him in the last months, but she refrained from kissing him due to her religious beliefs and because she was not confident he could be the right man for her. She was trying to be prudent and desired not to start loving Tarek since she felt a sensation of danger in his company. A few days later, he proposed to her to visit him in his apartment in the desert where his company was located. "You will have to reach by ten when the labour leaves the apartment for the morning shift. We will have three hours, then we have to leave lest they find us both in the same place. Nobody shall see you. The neighbours are Arab families, they may denounce me to my boss, and both of us may get into serious trouble. I have experience with this". Two mornings later, she was in his place. She had to wake up very early and take two buses to reach the desert, the second of which was full so that she remained seated in the sun for a long time. He called her being so mad, "did you catch the bus? You are so dumb. How could you not get in." While walking in the corridor separating two apartments, one of the younger workers did see Laura. Tarek looked back at her with an assassin gaze, which did not require any other words of explanation. Then with a fierce gesture pushed her inside. To her surprise, he was having breakfast. He was smoking on an old armchair while cockroaches ran on the short walls of the apartment. He was in a contemplative state and divided his breakfast into small cubes drawing vertical and horizontal lines in succession on the surface of the cake. No words. Laura waited, silence. She did want to start a conversation, but she thought she could not disturb this private and essential moment. Perhaps her words would have been unsuitable for the seriousness of the breakfast situation, so she remained quiet. Finally, after thirty minutes of silence, Tarek started talking at length about the ingredients of this cake, the precise procedure, the time for each step, and the quantity of each ingredient. "Yalla habibti, do we want to start our party? What did you come here for? Come closer to me." said Tarek at one point. Laura let him encircle her with his warm arms, but she was sweating fear about her man. 
                        </p>

                        <p>After vividly recalling these events, the phone was still ringing. Tarek was waiting for an answer. Then, while shaking on the floor, knees in her arms, Laura had a realization. She was internally terrified by Tarek. For the first time, she started sensing the prison bars constructed for her over the past four months. Her complex identity had been diminished to a character without a human dimension. Not a single of her thoughts was heard, as they were constantly neglected and ridiculed. So that she had stopped talking altogether. Laura had stopped thinking: her mind was often blank due to the lack of dialogue. She felt emptied and useless. She was continually waiting to be seen and heard, but when Tarek spoke to her, it was only to assert his own self. Laura was nothing to him, if not his own reflection. Not to mention that Laura had been deprived of agency. Laura couldn't decide what to do in his company, for example, the location of their dates or what to eat. Tarek was furious whenever she made decisions in conflict with his opinion. "Laura, you don't listen to me". Her position of inferiority was justified since she had been diminished to a mere university student, unaware of the world of adults. In contrast, Tarek had imposed his role as a mature working man who felt entitled to think and decide for her. The power dynamics in the relationships were unbalanced, which explained the impossibility of a change. Laura could not recognize herself anymore: she had ceased existing as a distinct individual, and her life made sense mainly in relation to him. The joyful, funny and knowledgeable Laura was lost. "I don't ever want to talk to you again". She finally replied on the phone, "I should spit in your face for everything you have done to me."</p>


                        <p>Laura had already booked a flight to leave the next day to Italy, as he had decided to leave the man for good. He begged to meet her one last time, and his words seemed sincere. "Now that I lost you, I lost everything". Laura felt compassion in front of the humiliation and fragility of the strong man and agreed to meet him for a goodbye. A feeling of tenderness overtook her seeing his face and sitting next to him. He seemed deeply sad. They started talking until she realized they felt completed by the presence of the other; they were happy, and ending their story would not be sensical or fair. Despite everything, a deep love was uniting them. He told her that he had reflected and understood his faults, that he should pay more attention to Laura and consider her opinion. He promised her to change and that he would do anything not to lose her. He explained that he was kept unaware of the situation. He did not receive any signal from her side about her feelings; better communication would undoubtedly have prevented the buildup of negative emotions. She listened to him. She felt understood and seen. Laura asked him to leave the desert and return to the city that night. She wanted to promise Tarek eternal love by making love with him, which he insisted on postponing until she felt ready.</p>


                        <p>At the end of the summer, Laura came back from abroad. Tarek had moved to Dubai, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as he had been fired by his previous employer for excessive arguing. So the two lovers could meet only after a few weeks of her return. Tarek was definitely changed. He listened to her and was interested in what she had to say. The severe grimace of annoyance on Tarek's face had been replaced with eyes full of love and a genuine smile. He often made jokes about himself and her, and they spent most of their time laughing together.
                        Nonetheless, Laura could never acquire agency regarding her actions because Tarek felt entitled to decide for both of them; despite Laura's frequent complaints, he would proceed in his conviction undisturbed. He remained strict regarding what she could or could not do in the university; she was not allowed to drink or participate in parties. Tarek remained at the centre of the relationship. He behaved in effect like a king whose desires had to be met. He requested from her that she would meet him every weekend by taking the public bus and moving to his city, inconsiderate of her health and academic commitments. The journey to Dubai would take a total of four hours, and it included changing two buses and taking the metro. Laura was constantly courted on the journey by several strangers, who would approach her while she was waiting at the bus stops or on the bus itself,  willing to make her acquaintance and ask for her phone number;  this made Tarek jealous and preoccupied. Once in the city, Tarek would decide what they would do during her time with him. It was not uncommon for him to ignore her; Tarek would complete house chores and do his errands. He would often complain about her movements and clumsiness and the added disorder that her presence added to the room. Tarek was annoyed at the slightest noise of the door or how she cooked and washed dishes. So it became a habit for him to shout at her or ask her to go back to Abu Dhabi without previous notice.</p>

                        <p>It was a Sunday night. Laura had to return to Abu Dhabi as lectures were scheduled for the next day. It was eleven, and Tarek deemed it unsafe and disrespectful for his girlfriend to take the public bus where she was likely to meet other men. He wanted to keep her with him. A flash of folly illuminated his eyes. He locked the room's lock and kept the key tight in his hands. Laura tried to take the key away, but he was too strong, so she fought with him. Unsuccessful, she tried to open the door and compulsively moved the handle up and down. Laura begged him to open the door and kissed his feet. She was ready to humiliate herself, not to forgo her freedom. Laura understood once again that she was trapped. That room symbolized the same prison that surrounded her only a few months ago. It was the prison of invisibility and self nullification in which she was deprived of power and rights. Tarek menaced that he would leave her once and for all if she left the room. She promptly replied that nothing could ever come before her freedom, and hence he should go away from her and open the door. After some resistance, tired, Tarek opened the door. Tarek then knocked at each door of his neighbourhood's partition in the shared apartment, apologizing for his girlfriend's impolite and rumorous behaviour as she was, unfortunately, crazy. Laura quickly collected her things and ran away from the apartment. </p>

                        <p>"Laura, he clearly showed you that he wants to be your master, do not give zero value to your life", read a text message from her father. Laura and her father would rarely talk due to their complicated family history. But Laura knew her father could understand the gravity of Tarek's action, while all her friends would justify him as his behaviour seemed an attempt to protect her. Laura rebelled again against his boyfriend. She stopped replying to his messages and grew distant. She clearly told him that such action can never be accepted in her culture, as freedom is considered the first and most important right of the individual. She had been raised to be free. Laura told him that If he could not respect that, he shall stop chasing her and find someone fit for him. Tarek was angry, convinced that Laura always tended to read his actions as oppressive while they had been conceived as acts of love. He complained that she was not listening to him; she did not understand enough. Inflexible, Laura demanded a more equal relationship in which Tarek would have to come to Abu Dhabi and visit her every other time, as it was too much to handle for her studies; she was tired and stressed. She wanted him to come so she could maintain more independence and not have to always fit into his routine. Tarek did not like to compromise and claimed that it would be too expensive for him to rent hotel rooms in addition to the partition in Dubai. And reminded her that he suffered from anxiety and that it would be too hard for him to move and depend on buses. Eventually, Laura bribed with chocolate a friend, Jithin, to purchase a used car in her name (this also put her in an inconvenient situation with his friend who liked her). The endeavour consumed most of her time and savings. This was the only solution to maintain her dignity and saneness and maximize the time for her studies. Laura consequently deemed the car the best purchase she had ever made, but Tarek had discouraged her from buying it. He would not support her by helping her find the right offer or offering financial help despite him being the man, the Engineer, and her being only a college student. He promptly named the car Paratha, a derogatory nickname as the car previously belonged to a Pakistani family, a nationality that he deemed inferior to his.</p>

                        <p>Tarek had recently asked her to marry him so that he could change his nationality, go back and visit his dying mother and escape the military service in his own country. He claimed that achieving a new passport would be the only way for him to see his mother. Laura started taking the issue at heart. She would never forgive herself if the person she loved could not see his mother again before her death. She considered the implication of marrying Tarek in the realm of religion and ethics. Her head had been spinning for days when a friend informed her that there was at least one other way for Tarek to go back to his country, which implied converting his working visa to a student visa for a period of time. Tarek had lied to her, inconsiderate of her love for him, her family, independence, and career. He had offended the holiness of the sacrament of marriage in both their religions. She wondered how anyone could be so cynical and wicked as to use the dearest person to them for their greedy objectives. She started finally understanding that the nature of Tarek's love was not utterly genuine, as it expressed itself with manipulation. It was a selfish love from a narcissist man who puts himself first and justifies his superior role in the couple based on his superior gender.</p>

                        <p>On a late Sunday night, Paratha, the car, stopped working as Laura accompanied Tarek back to Dubai under his irremovable request. The car overheated due to the lack of water in the coolant, which Laura had forgotten the existence of. "How stupid are you not to know about this? I had told you not to buy a car. You don't listen to me". Despite being annoyed by his words, she felt blessed by God that they were both alive and no accident had occurred. 
                        Soon she understood that it had been very easy for her to lose her power. She could not communicate fluently in Arabic on the phone, and Tarek would not let her interact with a stranger. Tarek called the insurance hotline and, while waiting for an answer, blamed her for not keeping track of the number he had casually found in the papers of the glove compartment. As he was distracted ranting, Laura made a few calls to the car's previous owner and to Jithin. Finally, Laura proposed to transfer the vehicle to Mussafah, where most car workshops are located. Mussafah is an industrial area at the periphery of Abu Dhabi, frequented mostly by immigrants from Pakistan and India who work there. There are no women in the dangerous streets at night. Laura felt unrestricted and confided that the UAE is one of the safest countries; hence, she went to Mussafah a few times with her friend Jithin when trying to purchase a car. The night Paratha broke, without any fear, she was standing with Tarek on the higher part of the unleveled floor in front of the workshop, dominating the square. Tarek discussed with the mechanic in a simple broken Urdu - Arabic conversation, which Laura could understand. Tarek did not allow her to call the carry-carrying trailer, but there was no way for her to ever say a word to the mechanic, as Tarek directed the conversation with him and took his phone number. Even in the following days, she could never address the mechanic directly if not at the moment of compensating him for substituting the cooling system. This time, she did not feel inferior to Tarek. Instead, she was disgusted by the ignorance of her boyfriend, the mechanic, and all the men around her. Although Laura was the car owner, they did not address her directly since she was a woman. In Mussafah, Laura belonged to Tarek, the man who would make the decisions regarding the car, the reason why other men could not approach her. It was a mentality which felt archaic, as if she was cattle and belonged to his patron, who would walk her to the river to drink water.
                        "Do you have any friends who can pick us up from this place?" said Tarek. Laura wanted to leave and return to a more normal place, so she quickly called Jithin. In minutes, Jithin reached with his car to accompany the two back to Hamdan street. "You are a mutherfucker," Tarek told her. "He is coming here to fuck you". "Where did you meet this man?!" Shouted Tarek, furious. "I met him in Hamdan. He approached me, and he seemed like a good person. He helped me find and purchase Paratha, talking in Hindi with the previous owner", responded Laura. "You are breaking my trust, Laura. I will break up with you soon. You fucked him. You must have; otherwise, he would not come so quickly". Laura was devastated by his words as if he had forgotten her honesty and religious beliefs. She was uneasy, but deep down, she was amused at the stupidity of Tarek's thinking. Tarek believed that as a partner, he should be her only close man friend; he acted as if he owned her and would speak and decide for her when other men were involved. He could so vehemently shout at her publicly call her a whore under the bright round moon of the dry Saturday night. </p>

                        <p>A few days later, Tarek ended up in a hospital for the fourth time due to his history of eating disorders. He then became addicted to morphine and tramadol while in the hospital. One of the doctors of Burjeel, a renowned hospital in Abu Dhabi, warned Laura. "I am much more concerned for you than I am for him. He has one of the most unstable minds I have seen in my long career. As shown by the scars on his stomach, he was abused in his childhood, and he will soon release his violence on you. You are too young to remain alone in this country; Your father should put you on a plane and fly you back. Do not marry this man". Laura felt that the doctor was exaggerating, but certainly, his prediction did not reassure her. Rather than violence, Laura was concerned about Tarek's way of thinking. Laura asked her boyfriend if she could leave the hospital as it had too big an impression on her. Tarek replied that she was a horrible person who could just leave her boyfriend alone in a horrible situation. He kept offending Laura, iterating how flawed and hypocritical of a person she was. Laura insulted him. He grew even more furious and responded by grabbing her from behind, putting her with her chest against the floor and twisting her arms until she whined in pain. He wanted her to listen to him and give her a glimpse of what he could do to her if she did not obey. Laura had never been touched or attacked before, and her parents never exerted a gesture of violence in her regard. She was not born for violence, servitude or assertiveness. 
                        You may wonder why then she kept staying. Because Tarek had changed in the past and because Tarek did love her more than anyone else ever had. She knew this with certainty from his eyes and his touch. She had promised him to remain with words and facts, and their love was solid. But, while she decided to stay, Nothing led her to believe that things would not get worse. Particularly given the repeated pattern of folly in Tarek's eyes. Laura knew that something was bound to happen to her when folly presented itself in his eyes. Tarek's love could not serve as protection from his unpredictable madness, and she knew that Tarek's rage could one day kill her. 
                        So why does she keep staying? She remains disoriented and hopeless. Walking within a world of fear and pain, lonely and with a heart full of love.</p>



                        <h2 class="section-heading">Story Explanation</h2>

                        <h3>Overview </h3>

                        <p>The story is inspired by real events. It is set in Abu Dhabi, where the events occurred, in 2021. The story recounts the encounter and the relationship between Tarek and Laura, two expats in the UAE who share a different value system and mentality. The United Arab Emirates is a vibrant international community composed of many different nationalities; immigrants compose 88.52% of the population (“United Arab Emirates Population Statistics 2022”, 2022). 
                        The interaction and misunderstanding between different cultures could, to some extent, contribute to the formation of the abuse as patterns of abuse are harder to recognize when expressed in other cultures. In addition, being an immigrant contributes to isolation and the lack of a family support system. The nationality of the protagonists is provided (Italian and Egyptian). However, this text is not trying to create or strengthen certain stereotypes. We shall not generalize abuse to a specific nationality, religion or state.  </p>

                        <h3>Structure </h3>

                        <p>Opening scene: The text opens itself with a phone call from Tarek, which occurs three months following the start of their relationship. This scene attempts to describe the physical response of Laura’s body to psychological abuse. The phone symbolizes the abuse by representing intrusion into Laura’s privacy. This scene depicts the feeling of fear and despair which results from psychological abuse. The phone also represents a turning point in the relationship, as Laura first senses the abuse when she hears the phone. The scene conveys that the victim of abuse may not be able to identify psychological abuse until late in the relationship when two lovers are united and difficult to separate.</p>

                        <p>Flashback: The flashback following the opening scene portrays the events which lead to the formation of the abusive relationship. It describes the gradual transformation of the relationship and the creation of unbalanced power dynamics in which Laura has lost any agency. As a result, Laura transforms and grows submissive, quiet and powerless.  </p>

                        <p>Resolution: Back to the starting point of the story (the phone call), Laura gains understanding regarding her situation. She understands she has lost her fundamental human rights, id est the ability to speak and act. Laura rebels. The return of Laura to her own country is a pause in the narrative, which delineates a new phase of the relationship. While Laura gains some power in speaking and Tarek becomes affectionate to her, Tarek remains her Master, and he makes decisions for Laura inconsiderate of her willingness. Tarek tries to impose his strength on Laura when she rebels by using physical strength, first by closing her in the room and twisting her arms in the hospital. However, Laura is not a passive character and fights for her freedom. Manipulation is described in the scene in which Tarek lies to Laura about the necessity of a marriage between them. </p>

                        <p>Moral: At the end, the writer directly addresses the reader and anticipates the reader’s question, “why didn’t she leave?” especially since Laura is aware of being a victim of abuse. The writer concludes with an internal monologue by Laura. She explains that the two lovers are united by deep love and their promise of eternal love: they are not supposed to separate according to their religious background.   </p>


                        <h3> Characters and Analysis</h3>

                        <p> The dynamic of the two characters is unbalanced. Laura and Tarek are in a Master-slave relationship. Tarek, the man, is the Master: Tarek is acting “like a king that wants to be served”. The man defines which behaviours of Laura are safe and dignified (as portrayed by the scene set in Mussafah). Furthermore, the man is entitled to rule and make decisions for both, which will benefit him regardless of Laura’s desires. Tarek is egoistic and does not recognize Laura at an equal level. The Master diminishes and devalues Laura So that he can gain authority and power and raise his ego.</p> 

                        <p>Similarly, Laura, the slave, has lost her personality and assumes the role of servant. As a result, the slave gains recognition as the Master depends on her to acquire recognition. Amy Hollywood explains this concept in Sensible Ecstasy Mysticism, Sexual Difference, and the Demands of History: “Women, although freed through their own actions, are still dependent on men for recognition of their subjectivities” (p. 163, Hollywood, 2002). Therefore, The two characters are dependent on one another according to the dynamics of the master-slave relationship, making the bond harder to break. Dependency as per the master-slave relationship is one of the main reasons the victim of abuse cannot leave the relationship.  </p>

                        <p>The Hegelian Feminist analysis of our text is in contraposition with Karakurt’s research. The study concludes that men are just as likely as women to be abused emotionally and that hence gender is not a good predictor of psychological abuse (Karakurt & Silver, 2013). The study rejects feminist perspectives, which view relationship violence as an expression of patriarchal oppression against women. Nonetheless, we should not neglect that this study is American. Hence, it does not represent countries and societies where the relationship between genders is not yet equal. In cultures where women do not have total freedom of choice, the man has the authority to make decisions due to his gender, and he asserts his authority on the woman to conform to the gender role of the man. Hence, gender roles are often used as justification for the development of psychological abuse. The scene set in Mussafah gives more background on gender roles and the position of women in the context of immigrant groups in the UAE.</p> 

                        <p>To add a layer of realism to the story, Tarek and Laura are portrayed as characters with complex psychological connotations. The two characters go outside the typical dichotomy of abuser/ abuse, which often describes the two characters as flat man is the abuser or dictator, and the woman is passive. Instead, Tarek loves Laura and sometimes does abusive actions to protect her (for example, closing her in the room at night). Similarly, Laura is not the commonly passive character who does not try to change the situation since she rebels multiple times. However, she never succeeds in acquiring agency and being fully understood and appreciated. </p>

                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>
